      <Card title="Our Impact Focus">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited exists to ensure that lawful mineral activity produces
          tangible local value—not only for members, but for the wider community. Our community impact
          approach prioritizes
          <strong> local employment</strong>, <strong>skills development</strong>, and inclusive participation,
          with deliberate attention to <strong>youth and women</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Our approach
          is to build real impact progressively through lawful operations, disciplined administration, and
          community-rooted participation.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Local Employment and Income Circulation">
        <p>
          Where operations occur, the Cooperative prioritizes structured pathways for local people to earn
          income through lawful work. This helps circulate money within rural communities and strengthens
          household stability.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          In addition to direct work, responsible mining activity can stimulate local value chains such as
          transport, food supply, basic services, and other community-based economic activity.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Skills Development and On-the-Job Learning">
        <p>
          Beyond income, we treat mineral development as a platform for skills development. Through structured
          participation, members and community participants are exposed to basic operational discipline, safety
          awareness, teamwork, and practical work routines that can translate into broader economic capability.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Over time, this strengthens the community’s capacity to participate more effectively in the formal
          economy and reduces dependence on informal, unsafe, or exploitative models.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Youth and Women Inclusion">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited recognizes that youth unemployment and limited economic inclusion
          are key drivers of poverty and instability. Our cooperative model is designed to create structured,
          lawful participation opportunities that intentionally include <strong>young people</strong> and
          <strong>women</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Inclusion is approached through participation pathways, fair access to opportunities, and a cooperative
          culture that values dignity, responsibility, and contribution.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Community Consultation and Stability">
        <p>
          We believe community impact begins before any activity starts. For this reason, the Cooperative affirms
          <strong>community consultation</strong> and consistent engagement with
          <strong>traditional leadership</strong> as core practices.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This approach helps avoid conflict, builds legitimacy, and ensures that mineral development is aligned
          with local realities and community expectations.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Broader Community Upliftment">
        <p>
          While the Cooperative does not make public quantitative promises, our long-term intent is that lawful,
          structured mineral activity contributes to broader community upliftment—through stronger local economies,
          increased capability, and improved community conditions.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          We begin in <strong>Masaiti District</strong>, with the intention that successful community-based models can
          be replicated in other parts of Zambia where communities sit on mineral-bearing land but remain excluded
          from meaningful participation.
