      <Card title="Membership Overview">
        <p>
          Membership in Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited is a structured form of
          participation in a lawful cooperative — not an informal arrangement.
          It is designed to protect members, the community, and the Cooperative
          through clear rules, democratic decision-making, and compliance with
          Zambia’s legal and institutional requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          We welcome community-minded applicants who align with our objectives
          and values, and who are prepared to contribute in a meaningful way.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Who Can Apply (Eligibility)">
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Applicants must be Zambian citizens aged 18 years or older.</li>
          <li>
            Applicants must support the objectives, values, and principles of
            the Cooperative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applicants must be willing to contribute in good faith — through
            labour, skills, access to land, equipment, or capital participation
            (as provided for under the By-Laws).
          </li>
          <li>
            Applicants must agree to abide by the By-Laws and the applicable
            cooperative legal framework in Zambia.
          </li>
          <li>

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[#355E4A]">
          Note: Where relevant, the Cooperative may consider practical
          contribution capacity when reviewing applications (e.g., skills,
          equipment, or land access), while maintaining fairness and integrity.

      <Card title="How Membership Works (Application & Admission)">
        <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Apply in writing:</strong> submit an application expressing
            interest and your intended contribution and role.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review:</strong> the Cooperative reviews applications to

            organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision:</strong> admission is not automatic. Acceptance is
            subject to approval by the Cooperative in line with its By-Laws and
            governance processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Onboarding:</strong> admitted members are oriented on
            Cooperative expectations, safety culture, and compliance standards.

        </ol>

        <p class="mt-4">
          The Cooperative reserves the right to accept or reject applications
