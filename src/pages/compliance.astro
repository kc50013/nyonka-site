      <Card title="Our Compliance Posture">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited is committed to operating within Zambia’s
          <strong> mining, environmental, labour, and local authority frameworks</strong>.
          We pursue structured community participation in a way that is lawful, accountable,
          and aligned with responsible mineral development.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Compliance is not treated as a formality. It is the foundation for legitimacy,
          safety, and stability—especially in rural areas where mineral activity can easily
          become informal or contested if governance is weak.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Working With Institutions and Regulators">
        <p>
          Our approach recognizes that lawful mining requires coordination with relevant
          institutions and oversight bodies. Where applicable, we engage and align with
          <strong> the Ministry of Mines</strong>,
          <strong> the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA)</strong>,
          and <strong> local government authorities (including councils)</strong>,
          alongside other relevant agencies connected to lawful operations.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          We maintain a compliance-first posture across licensing readiness, operational conduct,
          record discipline, and responsible reporting expectations.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Local Consent and Traditional Leadership">
        <p>
          We place strong emphasis on working with local communities and local traditional
          leadership because mineral development without consent can create conflict, mistrust,
          and long-term instability.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          For this reason, the Cooperative prioritizes early engagement, respectful consultation,
          and structured communication with residents and the traditional structures that govern
          them. This conflict-sensitive approach helps ensure that any future mineral activity
          proceeds with social legitimacy and shared understanding.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Labour and Safety Commitment">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited maintains a general commitment to responsible labour
          practices and a safety-first culture. Where operations occur, we promote discipline,
          basic safety orientation, and a structured approach that protects people and supports
          long-term participation.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Environmental Responsibility">
        <p>
          The Cooperative is committed to environmental stewardship. We recognize that mining
          activity can create environmental risks if unmanaged, and we therefore adopt a posture
          that prioritizes responsible conduct, prevention of avoidable harm, and progressive
          restoration aligned with regulatory expectations.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Transparency and Integrity">
        <p>
          Our cooperative model is built for accountability. We aim to operate in a manner that
          strengthens trust with communities and institutions through transparent administration,
          responsible decision-making, and a disciplined approach to lawful participation.
