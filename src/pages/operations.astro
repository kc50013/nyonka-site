      <Card title="Operational Approach">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited operates through a
          <strong> phased development model</strong>:
          <strong>
            licensing → site preparation → controlled community mining →
            local aggregation → lawful offtake
          </strong>,
          conducted in compliance with Zambia’s mining, environmental, labour,
          and local government requirements.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This approach is deliberate. It ensures that mineral development
          proceeds only where it is lawful, socially accepted, and institutionally
          supported, rather than informal or speculative.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Site Identification and Early Engagement">
        <p>
          The Cooperative has identified sites with visible mineral deposits that
          have remained unproductive for extended periods, in some cases for
          generations, while communities living on or near those lands continue
          to experience persistent poverty and limited economic opportunity.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Prior to any exploration or mining activity, Nyonka Mining Cooperative
          Limited has already initiated engagement with
          <strong> relevant stakeholders</strong>, including local residents and
          traditional leadership who live in, or govern over, these areas.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This engagement is intended to establish social legitimacy, manage
          expectations, prevent conflict, and ensure that any future mineral
          activity reflects local consent, shared understanding, and community
          participation from the outset.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Controlled Community Mining">
        <p>
          Where mining activities are undertaken, they are designed to be
          <strong> controlled, organized, and safety-guided</strong>.
          The Cooperative prioritizes structured participation over informal or
          unregulated practices.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Community members participate through an organized framework that
          emphasizes lawful conduct, basic safety discipline, environmental
          awareness, and accountability. This model reduces the risks commonly
          associated with informal mining while creating pathways for employment
          and skills development.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Safety and Environmental Stewardship">
        <p>
          Nyonka Mining Cooperative Limited recognizes that mining activity,
          if poorly managed, can pose risks to people and the environment.
          For this reason, the Cooperative adopts a
          <strong> safety-first and environment-conscious posture</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This includes basic safety orientation, appropriate use of protective
          equipment where applicable, responsible handling of materials, and
          progressive land rehabilitation practices aligned with regulatory
          expectations.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="Aggregation and Lawful Offtake">
        <p>
          Mineral output, where generated, is aggregated in a structured manner
          and directed toward
          <strong> lawful offtake channels</strong>.
          This ensures transparency, traceability, and compliance with applicable
          fiscal and reporting obligations.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Through this process, mineral activity is translated into legitimate
          economic participation, supporting local value chains while contributing
          to the formal economy.
        </p>
      </Card>

      <Card title="What We Do Not Do">
        <ul class="mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
          <li>• We do not engage in informal or illegal mining.</li>
          <li>• We do not bypass regulatory institutions or traditional authority.</li>
          <li>• We do not make speculative claims about production volumes or timelines.</li>
          <li>• We do not pursue extraction at the expense of safety, law, or community stability.</li>
        </ul>
