          <p class="text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
            Nyonka Mining Co-operative Limited is a community-rooted mining cooperative formed to participate in mineral
            development legally, transparently, and in coordination with Zambia’s regulatory and governance ecosystem—
            including traditional authorities, local councils, and national institutions responsible for mining and environmental
            oversight—so communities can convert dormant mineral potential into jobs, skills, and shared prosperity.
          </p>

          <div class="mt-4 space-y-3">
            <p class="text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
              Our work addresses a common challenge in many mineral-rich areas: informal or unsafe mining, limited
              local benefit, weak environmental controls, and low trust. We provide a structured cooperative pathway that
              prioritizes compliance with Zambia’s mining and environmental requirements, safe operations, transparent
              administration, and long-term community development.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
              We are focused on helping communities benefit not only from what is on the surface, but also from what
              lies underneath—responsibly and sustainably.

        <Card title="Where We Operate">
          <p class="text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
            We are currently active in <span class="font-medium text-[#1F3D2B]">Masaiti District, Copperbelt Province</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
            Our administrative base is in <span class="font-medium text-[#1F3D2B]">Kitwe</span>, Zambia’s mining hub.
            This gives us access to mining industry players, suppliers, and professional networks—strengthening our ability
            to support remote communities in Masaiti and, over time, across Zambia.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-[#355E4A] leading-relaxed">
            Our near-term mining focus includes <span class="font-medium text-[#1F3D2B]">iron</span>, while our broader
            mission is to help communities nationwide build lawful, community-owned mineral projects.
